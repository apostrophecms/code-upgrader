  <h1 align="center">Apostrophe Code Upgrader: A2 âž¡ A3</h1>
</p>

The Code Upgrader handles the majority of required modifications for an Apostrophe 2 codebase to run Apostrophe 3. It will also identify many specific lines and sections of code that a developer will need to convert manually.

**Status:** In development (not for production use)

Current test procedure:

* `git clone` this module in a separate location
* `npm install` in the module's folder
* Type `npm link` to make `apos-code-upgrader` globally available
* In a separate location, `git clone` your existing A2 project from git
* make sure you are `cd`'d into your project
* make sure `git status` is clean in your project
* Make a **new branch** called `3.0` in which to safely experiment with this tool
* Type `apos-code-upgrader lint`
* Note the issues it points out for attention in the project. No changes are made
* Optional: try typing `apos-code-upgrader convert`
* Afterwards, check out `git status`
* **To undo everything "convert" did and try again:** `apos-code-upgrader reset`

This tool will refuse to start if it does not see a git repository for the project. Please do not use this tool without appropriate version control to avoid losing 2.x project code.

The `convert` tool will rename `lib/modules` to `modules`, update every `index.js` file and make many other changes, including inlining the content of any files pulled in with the `require('./lib/something')(self, options)` pattern. Those files are removed.

This may sound scary, and indeed it is imperfect and you may have changes to make. However, that is why we have `git`. You can review the changes as a PR in github, or via `git diff HEAD`. Just make sure you work in a new git branch when using this tool.

Not every module and project is a good candidate for `convert`, as there are an infinite number of ways projects can be structured. `convert` works best on projects that adhere very closely to the coding style of our sample A2 projects.
